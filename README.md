# german-discord-bot
The basic idea is to create a discord bot that can translate German to English, granted there are a lot of German speakers in my gaming server.
A second idea would be to create a discord bot that keeps track of server events, game nights, and other activities and notifies users depending on the role associated with events.

Overview: 
I wanted to include this section to share a couple of thoughts. Working with this project taught me how to install and import different API's into vsc and to use discord's developer portal to create bots and apps which I will be experimenting with over the summer. Setting up the bot and bringing it online was by far the most difficult part of the project due to the fact that I have never used discord's developer portal, but overall the experience of working on something that I will frequently use was very exciting! 

Enjoy Ekay's German Bot!
