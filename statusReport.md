#### Project title

GermaBot is the name of the bot on discord

TODO

- hook google into the bot so it translates properly
- create other fun commands that give the bot more use

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have set up the token for the bot and done a couple tests when its online just to make sure it responds to certain commands. Easy commands have been tested such as a user typing "Ping" and the bot answering with "Pong". 
Additionally, I have begun research about using google translate for the bot to translate any german words. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not done any of the coding for the actual translation part of the bot yet, however I have mapped it out so that I have a plan on how to do so. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The only problem encountered so far has been the bot going offline occaisionally because I am hosting it from my PC. Even with the command window open, the bot does not always appear online or respond to commands.
